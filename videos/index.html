    <p style="font-size: 1.2rem; line-height: 1.8; color: #333; text-align: justify;">
      I am <strong>Prabhat Panthi</strong>, born in the peaceful hills of <strong>Gulmi Madane Ward No. 7</strong>. My early days were shaped by the simple yet rich culture of my village, teaching me the essence of hard work and family values.
    </p>

    <p style="font-size: 1.2rem; line-height: 1.8; color: #333; text-align: justify;">
      I did my schooling in <strong>Bhairahawa</strong>, where I was exposed to diverse people and experiences that broadened my perspective. My passion for learning and growing pushed me to pursue a Bachelor’s degree in <strong>Oxford College</strong>, specializing in <strong>Business Studies (BBS)</strong>.
    </p>

    <p style="font-size: 1.2rem; line-height: 1.8; color: #333; text-align: justify;">
      After graduation, I joined <strong>NIC Asia Laghubitta Microfinance</strong> and worked there for 4 years. It was a life-changing experience where I worked closely with rural communities, helping them with financial services and witnessing firsthand the impact of microfinance in empowering lives.
    </p>

    <p style="font-size: 1.2rem; line-height: 1.8; color: #333; text-align: justify;">
      Currently, I am focused on building my personal brand through my website, <strong>Mero Sansaar</strong>. This platform is my way of sharing stories, inspirational quotes, videos, jokes, and life lessons with the world. I believe every story matters, and my goal is to create a digital space filled with positivity and motivation.
    </p>

    <p style="font-size: 1.2rem; line-height: 1.8; color: #333; text-align: justify;">
      Life has been a journey of ups and downs, but every challenge has been a lesson that shaped my character. I believe in the power of consistency, learning from mistakes, and helping others grow. Through my content, I want to inspire people to believe in themselves, embrace struggles, and celebrate small victories.
    </p>

    <p style="font-size: 1.2rem; line-height: 1.8; color: #333; text-align: justify;">
      Thank you for visiting my world. Let’s walk this journey of life together, spreading smiles, stories, and inspiration.

    <h3 style="color: #b8860b; margin-bottom: 15px;">Elon Musk</h3>
    <p>Elon Musk was born on June 28, 1971, in Pretoria, South Africa, into a middle-class family. His childhood was marked by challenges — he was introverted, bookish, and often bullied by peers. Despite this, Elon displayed exceptional curiosity and intelligence from a young age, teaching himself computer programming at age 10 and creating a video game called Blastar by age 12, which he sold for $500.</p>
    
    <p>Elon’s early life wasn’t easy. He faced family difficulties, including his parents’ divorce, and struggled socially. In search of better opportunities, he moved to Canada at 17 to attend Queen’s University and later transferred to the University of Pennsylvania. Elon earned degrees in physics and economics, equipping himself with both scientific insight and business acumen.</p>
    
    <p>After dropping out of a PhD program at Stanford, he jumped into the tech startup world. He co-founded Zip2, a city guide software company, which was sold for nearly $300 million. Next came X.com, which evolved into PayPal, revolutionizing online payments.</p>
    
    <p>Despite early success, Elon’s journey was fraught with near financial ruin. Both Tesla and SpaceX faced multiple failed launches and production delays. Yet his relentless drive, belief in innovation, and willingness to risk everything saw him through. Today, Musk leads cutting-edge companies like Tesla, SpaceX, Neuralink, and The Boring Company, shaping the future of transportation, energy, and even space colonization.</p>
    
    <p>Elon Musk’s story is a testament to perseverance, creativity, and an unyielding vision — rising from a bullied kid in South Africa to one of the world’s most influential entrepreneurs.</p>

    <h3 style="color: #b8860b; margin-bottom: 15px;">Oprah Winfrey</h3>
    <p>Oprah Winfrey was born on January 29, 1954, in rural Kosciusko, Mississippi, to a teenage single mother living in poverty. Raised in a poor household, Oprah experienced hardship from an early age, including abuse and neglect. However, her strong spirit and intellect shone through despite adversity.</p>
    
    <p>As a child, Oprah excelled in school and won a scholarship to Tennessee State University. She began working in local media, initially as a news anchor and reporter. Oprah’s natural charisma and empathy helped her connect with viewers, making her talk shows highly popular.</p>
    
    <p>Her groundbreaking show, “The Oprah Winfrey Show,” launched in 1986, became the highest-rated daytime talk show in history, running for 25 years. Oprah used her platform to explore important social issues, promote literature, and empower audiences worldwide.</p>
    
    <p>Beyond television, Oprah became a billionaire businesswoman, philanthropist, and cultural icon, breaking barriers for African-American women in media. She founded her own television network and authored best-selling books.</p>
    
    <p>Her journey from poverty and abuse to global influence is a powerful example of resilience, compassion, and the transformative power of storytelling.</p>

    <h3 style="color: #b8860b; margin-bottom: 15px;">J.K. Rowling</h3>
    <p>Joanne Rowling, better known as J.K. Rowling, was born on July 31, 1965, in Yate, England. Raised in a modest household, Rowling’s childhood was marked by a passion for reading and storytelling. She studied French and Classics at the University of Exeter.</p>
    
    <p>After university, Rowling worked in various jobs while writing her famous Harry Potter series. The death of her mother deeply affected her and influenced the emotional depth of her writing. As a single mother living on welfare, Rowling wrote in cafes, often struggling financially.</p>
    
    <p>Her manuscript for “Harry Potter and the Philosopher’s Stone” was rejected by multiple publishers before being accepted by Bloomsbury. The series went on to become a worldwide phenomenon, selling over 500 million copies and spawning blockbuster movies.</p>
    
    <p>Rowling’s rise from poverty and hardship to becoming one of the most successful authors in history illustrates how talent and persistence can overcome adversity. Beyond writing, she has supported numerous charities and advocated for social justice.</p>

    <h3 style="color: #b8860b; margin-bottom: 15px;">Howard Schultz</h3>
    <p>Howard Schultz was born on July 19, 1953, in Brooklyn, New York, into a working-class family. His father worked low-wage jobs, often struggling to provide for the family. Schultz’s upbringing in a tough neighborhood inspired him to aim higher.</p>
    
    <p>He earned a football scholarship to Northern Michigan University and graduated with a degree in communications. Schultz began his career in sales and marketing before joining Starbucks in 1982 when it was a small coffee bean retailer.</p>
    
    <p>Inspired by Italian coffee culture, Schultz convinced Starbucks’ owners to expand into coffee shops serving espresso drinks. Under his leadership, Starbucks grew into a global coffee empire with thousands of stores worldwide.</p>
    
    <p>Schultz’s story is one of vision, leadership, and turning humble beginnings into a legacy. He also emphasizes corporate responsibility and has engaged in philanthropic efforts to support veterans and underprivileged youth.</p>
