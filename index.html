    <h2>Welcome to My World</h2>
    <p>
      Hello! I'm Prabhat Panthi, a passionate digital creator born in the serene hills of Gulmi, Nepal.
      My journey took me from the peaceful landscapes of Gulmi to the bustling city of Bhairahawa,
      and then to the vibrant town of Murgiya where I grew up.
    </p>
    <p>
      With a Bachelor’s degree completed, I have always been enthusiastic about technology,
      storytelling, and spreading positivity through creative content.
      This website is my personal space to share photos, videos, inspiring stories, jokes,
      and powerful motivational quotes from various holy scriptures.
    </p>
    <p>
      I believe in continuous learning, evolving, and connecting with people worldwide.
      Here, you'll not only find glimpses of my personal journey but also content
      that aims to motivate and entertain.
    </p>
    <p>
      Feel free to explore and get in touch with me through the Contact section below.
      Let's stay connected and grow together!

    <h2>About Me</h2>
    <div class="home-banner">
      <img src="images/newa.jpg" alt="Prabhat Panthi About" />
    </div>
    <p>
      I was born in Gulmi, a beautiful hilly district of Nepal known for its rich culture and heritage.
      Later, my family moved to Bhairahawa where I experienced a vibrant city life.
      Eventually, we settled in Murgiya, a place that played a big role in shaping who I am today.
    </p>
    <p>
      From a young age, I was curious about technology and storytelling.
      This curiosity led me to pursue a Bachelor's degree, where I honed my skills in digital media and communication.
    </p>
    <p>
      Besides digital content, I have a keen interest in reading motivational books,
      listening to spiritual discourses, and understanding various cultures and philosophies.
    </p>
    <p>
      One of my core beliefs is that every person has a unique story,
      and through creativity and positive mindset, we can all inspire each other to grow.
    </p>
    <p>
      Through this platform, I aim to share stories that uplift spirits,
      jokes that bring smiles, and wisdom from ancient scriptures that enlighten minds.
      Every piece of content here reflects my journey of learning and sharing.
    </p>
    <p>
      Outside the digital world, I enjoy traveling, meeting new people,
      and immersing myself in nature. I believe that staying connected to our roots keeps us humble and grounded.
    </p>
    <p>
      Thank you for visiting my website. Let’s continue this journey together,
      sharing laughter, wisdom, and positivity across borders!

      <h3>The Journey of Chester Charles Bennington</h3>
       <p>
    Chester Charles Bennington was born on <strong>March 20, 1976, in Phoenix, Arizona, USA</strong>. His childhood was filled with challenges — his parents divorced when he was 11, and he faced bullying, emotional neglect, and even abuse. These struggles led Chester into a dark path of depression and substance abuse from a young age.
  </p>
  <p>
    However, <strong>music became his ultimate escape</strong>. Influenced by bands like Stone Temple Pilots, Chester developed a unique, raw vocal style that could switch from soothing melodies to powerful screams, capturing the emotions of millions.
  </p>
  <p>
    Chester’s life took a pivotal turn when he joined <strong>Linkin Park in 1999</strong>. The band’s debut album <em>“Hybrid Theory” (2000)</em> became a global phenomenon, giving a voice to a generation dealing with frustration, identity, and emotional struggles. Songs like <em>“In the End”</em>, <em>“Crawling”</em>, and <em>“Numb”</em> resonated deeply with fans worldwide.
  </p>
  <p>
    Despite his success, Chester continuously battled with inner demons. He used his platform to speak openly about mental health, encouraging others to seek help and never be ashamed of their struggles. Tragically, Chester passed away on <strong>July 20, 2017</strong>, leaving behind a legacy that still inspires millions.
  </p>
  <p>
    Chester’s journey from a tormented childhood to becoming a global rock icon is a story of <strong>pain, passion, and the power of art to heal</strong>. His voice lives on, reminding us that <em>“it's okay to not be okay”</em> — and that seeking help is a sign of strength, not weakness.
